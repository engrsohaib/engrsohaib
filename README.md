Below is my work history:

RWR Pvt Ltd	Design Engineer 
02.2020 â€“ present	Islamabad â€“ Pakistan

Working as an embedded systems engineer with state-of-the-art Xilinx Ultrascale / Ultrascale+ SOCs and SOMs. Primarily I design programmable hardware in Verilog for active and passive radar systems and Software Design Radios (SDRs). Moreover, I also lead multiple projectsâ€™ design verifications.

Highlights are as follows:
â€¢	Extensive work on System Performance Verification, defining SystemVerilog-based models for ASICs while meeting the general specifications and functionality. Defining cycle-accurate Bus Functional Models. Understand CSH scripting language for designing Linux-based verification environments.
â€¢	Expertise in modern verification methodologies like constrained random/directed testing techniques and checks via monitors and scoreboards. Static Timing Analysis. Defining test plans.
â€¢	Expertise in SOC and FPGA Design Emulation, Block and chip-level simulation using modern EDA toolkits.
â€¢	Expertise in RTL development. Defining custom transport and data layers for high-speed interfaces (PCI-E and JESD204B). Packaging custom IPs. Designing complex systems via commonly available and custom-made IPs. Troubleshooting Logic Synthesis issues. Closing timing and placing/routing issues.
â€¢	Understanding of clocking management in Ultrascale/Ultrascale+ based architectures. Understanding of user-defined constraints for managing multiple clock domain architectures. Expertise in Clock Domain Crossing.
â€¢	Expertise in board-level debugging via chip scopes. Expertise with lab tools to zero in on the root cause of hardware-level problems during production cycles.
â€¢	In-depth understanding of AXI4, AHB, APB, JESD204B interface, PCI-E, SPI, UART, i2C, DMA (normal and Scatter Gather), Cypress FX3s GPIF2, LVDS, SERDES, GTH (5Gbps), and other minor communication protocols.
â€¢	Development of an AXI4 based memory model for recording DMA transactional data complete with filing, monitoring, transaction classes and score boarding.
â€¢	Expertise in Synopsys VCS, DVE, Xilinx Vivado, Lattice Diamond and Intel Quartus.

C.A.S.E Islamabad	Lab Engineer 
02.2017 â€“ 01.2020	Islamabad, Pakistan

â€¢	My work here included but not limited to conducting under-grad labs for digitals system design, digital signal processing, embedded systems design and computer architecture.
â€¢	I have the honor of supervising/co-supervising more than 6 projects at the undergrad level in fields of SoCs based FPGA, ML, AI and business intelligence. 
â€¢	I also supervised multiple student FPGA prototypes for small scale projects.

MIPRG COMSATS Islamabad	Researcher 
09.2015 â€“ 06.2017	Islamabad, Pakistan

â€¢	The main focus of MIPRG is to accelerate MR imaging modalities.
â€¢	I worked on the acceleration of Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting by implementing it on NVIDIA GPUs.
â€¢	I was able achieve required milestones while meeting deadlines. Improved overall compute speed by at least 14%.
â€¢	Published my work in the following international conferences:
o	33rd European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB) Conference, Vienna, Austria (October 2016) 
o	GPU Technology Conference (GTC), San Jose, California, US (2017).
â€¢	My second project is related to rectangular matrices inversion on FPGA for use in medical imaging applications.
